The Wave Card format is the format found in the Yamaha Wave Data ROM Cards created for the SY Series synths to expand the Wave Content.

You can also now use the Sector 101 Wave Blade product (https://sector101.co.uk/waveblade.html) to create your own sample content now for the SY series using the Wave Card support in sy.factory (https://www.xfactory-librarians.co.uk/products.html).

The SY Wave Card format is essentially a ROM image with the structured data within it. Note that the data is LITTLE ENDIAN.
