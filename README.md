# YamahaSynthFileFormats
A repository of Yamaha Synthesizer File Formats

I have been programming patch librarians for 25 years, which has involved a lot of reverse engineering of file formats in hex editors

As a number of people have been recently asking for information, and whilst I do not want to release my librarian source code, I decided to publish the information I have on the file formats.

I am publishing the information in 010 Editor Template format. Whilst you do not need 010 Editor to read the templates, as they are written in a C like code syntax, the power of an 010
Editor template is that you can run it over a file to decode the information within the 010 Editor
